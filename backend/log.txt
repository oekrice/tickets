Train code log

Created virtual environment for this:

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate.csh

Basic example is working reasonably well, but is very slow. Need multithreading for the trains I think... Not sure how many one can get away with. Maybe set this up for every hour during the window, and Waterloo etc. will just take a little longer? Yes.
